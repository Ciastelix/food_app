Sure! Here's the documentation for the "diet app" project:

## diet app

The "diet app" is a Python application built using the FastAPI framework. It provides an API for managing user accounts, generating meal plans, and retrieving recipe information.

### Project Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
name = "diet app"
version = ""
description = ""
authors = [
    {name = "Ciastelix", email = "mateusz.zwierzynski@hotmail.com"},
]
dependencies = [
    "fastapi>=0.100.0",
    "uvicorn[standard]>=0.22.0",
    "dependency-injector>=4.41.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
    "sqlalchemy>=2.0.16",
    "werkzeug>=2.3.6",
    "passlib>=1.7.4",
    "aiokafka>=0.8.1",
    "python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0",
    "requests>=2.31.0",
    "pydantic<2,>1.8",
    "bcrypt>=4.0.1",
    "pydantic-core>=2.3.0",
]
requires-python = ">=3.11"
license = {text = "MIT"}
```

### Project Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

```
./users
├── containers.py
├── db.py
├── endpoints.py
├── main.py
├── models.py
├── repositories.py
├── schemas.py
├── services.py
└── utils.py
```

### Container Configuration (`containers.py`)

The `Container` class in `containers.py` is responsible for managing the application's dependencies using the `dependency-injector` library. It sets up dependency injection for various components of the application.

### Database Configuration (`db.py`)

The `Database` class in `db.py` defines the SQLAlchemy database configuration. It provides methods for creating a database and managing database sessions.

### Endpoints (`endpoints.py`)

The `endpoints.py` file contains the FastAPI router that defines all the API endpoints for the application. It includes endpoints for user authentication, user management, recipe retrieval, and meal plan generation.

### Main Application (`main.py`)

The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application. It sets up the FastAPI application, initializes the database, and includes the endpoint router.

### Models (`models.py`)

The `models.py` file contains the SQLAlchemy model definitions for the application's database tables. It defines the `User`, `FavoriteRecipe`, and `Meal` models.

### Repositories (`repositories.py`)

The `repositories.py` file contains the repository classes responsible for interacting with the database. It provides methods for querying and modifying user data, recipe data, and meal data.

### Schemas (`schemas.py`)

The `schemas.py` file defines the Pydantic models used for request and response validation in the application. It includes models for user input, user output, token data, and more.

### Services (`services.py`)

The `services.py` file contains the service classes that handle business logic for the application. They use the repository classes to interact with the database and provide high-level functionality to the API endpoints.

### Utilities (`utils.py`)

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions used throughout the application. It includes functions for password hashing, token generation, and more.

In order to run the "diet app" project successfully, you need to set up a `.env` file with the appropriate values. The `.env` file should be located in the root directory of the project and should contain the necessary environment variables.

Please make sure to create a `.env` file and set the following environment variables with their corresponding values:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for connecting to your database.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key used for JWT token generation.
- `ALGORITHM`: The algorithm used for JWT token encoding.
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`: The expiration time for JWT access tokens, in minutes.
- `KEY`: Your RapidAPI key for accessing the Spoonacular API.
- `HOST`: The RapidAPI host for accessing the Spoonacular API.

Ensure that you have the appropriate values for these environment variables before running the application.

Note: The application relies on the `python-dotenv` library to load the environment variables from the `.env` file. Make sure to install this library (`python-dotenv`) in your Python environment.
